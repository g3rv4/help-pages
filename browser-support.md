# What browsers do we support?

Stack Overflow supports the last two stable versions of major browsers. This does not include beta/dev releases, which are not supported.

The browsers we support can be [visualized][1] using our [Browserlist][2] configuration string.

If your browser isnâ€™t in this list, it still may work, but with a degraded experience.
